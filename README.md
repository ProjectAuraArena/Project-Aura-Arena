# Project Aura Arena
A new Dota 2 Map made under the Reborn Tools, created by Reddit user /u/Dawn-Knight-Sean as a project for /r/dawngate.

Aura Arena is a Dota 2 mod using a unique map, no mana costs on abilities, and no need for buying Boots at the shop. All of this will result in fast-paced gameplay

The code in this repository is to be written in Lua/C++, and should be used for the scripts on the npcs_customs_abilities.txt file.

Use the same abilities used by the base heroes in Dota 2, however, set the AbilityManaCost value to 0.

As Aura Arena is developed, I'll balance abilities around a manaless environment based on feedback. As each manaless ability is submitted, I'll add it to the npcs_custom_heroes.txt file.

Storm Spirit and Skywrath Mage should not be made manaless - balance issues.

Make sure the manaless abilities are loaded in game, meaning edit the npcs_custom_heroes.txt file and make sure the abilities load in Dota 2.
